We know first-hand the trials and tribulations that accompany managing, organizing, and distributing work orders to technicians.\n\nWe have five steps to improve your maintenance team’s workflow and to streamline your work order management.\n\n## Step One: Ensure Engagement\n\nUnit 203 needs her shower fixed, while unit 309 has a leaky sink. They both keep calling you repeatedly, frantic about their service requests (living under the common misconception that more calls equate to faster service). Plus, one of your property managers wants to push off a move-in date because the unit needs new toilet tanks.\n\nMeanwhile, your on-site plumber, Bill, is sitting in the property's shop and watching Squid Games on his tablet.\n\nUsually, these types of situations arise when communication is poor between managers, technicians, and residents. Also, the property manager or leasing office might have a favorite technician who they use by default, not realizing that their workload is already maxed out.\n\nAvoid such scenarios by staying on top of your technicians daily. Make sure work orders are distributed evenly so that every technician has work to do every day.\n\nIf you're struggling to maintain balanced workloads, then you might want to research a digital solution for managing work orders. When the managers, technicians, and residents all have access to the same digital work order and receive real-time updates whenever the task is updated, then communication improves.\n\nPlus, with the right software platform, you'll be able to see with one glance how many work orders each technician already has assigned to them while assigning a new work order.\n\nBetter scheduling enables you to ensure that every member of your team keeps busy. Staying on top of work order assignments increases resident satisfaction and resident retention.\n\n## Step Two: Plan Ahead\n\nImagine Bill (from above) suddenly getting the previously waiting tasks in the middle of the day. He gets up eagerly to do the work, but when he goes to fix unit 203’s shower, she isn’t home and her chihuahua is growling at the door. Then he goes to fix 309’s sink, just to realize he’s run out of coupling nuts.\n\nAfter running to the hardware store and finishing the sink, he goes to the vacant unit and realizes that no one ordered the toilet tanks. Now he can’t finish that task, and he has to circle back to unit 203, on the opposite side of the property.\n\nIf all these tasks has been assigned at the beginning of the day or the end of the previous day, Bill would have had a chance to clarify details and schedule his visits beforehand. Did someone order the toilet tanks? Does he have all the tools and parts he needs? When will the resident in unit 203 be at home?\n\nBy planning before he starts his rounds, he can make sure to prepare the correct tools and purchase any missing parts beforehand. He can plan the most efficient route, and make sure the chihuahua is locked up before he arrives.\n\n<!-- ![Screenshots of AppWork on iMac screens](img-mid-five-steps.png) -->\n\n## Step Three: Play to Your Strengths\n\nWhen a plumbing problem arises, you’ll want to send Bill; but when a resident is complaining about broken air conditioning, then you should send Jimmy, your resident HVAC expert. Even if a technician doesn’t have a specific specialty, chances are they will have strengths and weaknesses. A technician who enjoys fixing cabinets will do a better job than one who doesn’t.\n\nBy sending the appropriate technician to each job, you’ll save time and increase resident satisfaction. The right person will complete the job faster and do better work, leading to fewer callbacks. Fewer callbacks boost the confidence that residents have in your maintenance teams.\n\nAdditionally, you can save a lot of money by sending the technician with the right skillset. Replacement costs make up a significant percentage or your operating budget. Imagine the difference in costs between a technician who knows how to fix broken AC units, versus one who automatically defaults to replacing them.\n\nWhile this step is obvious in principle, it can be difficult to implement. It’s hard for property managers always to know which technician excels at which tasks, or which technician will be better for a particular task versus others. You can keep an eye out for differentiators over time, and discover strong points through trial and error.\n\nTake skillset management to the next level by harnessing cutting-edge technology that increases the scope and depth of your skill assessments.\n\nHow much time does tech A take to complete tasks within different categories? For which tasks does he receive higher ratings versus tech B? How many callbacks does he get within each category compared to others?\n\nYou can get the answers with a software platform that determines, tracks, and organizes skill levels using hundreds of data points and evolving algorithms (powered by machine learning).\n\n## Step Four: Work Efficiently\n\nNow that you’re assigning work orders the night before, or first thing in the morning, you can further streamline your technicians’ days by checking for work orders within the same building, unit, or property. This keeps your technicians from running in circles and wasting time on traveling.\n\nBesides alleviating the maintenance teams’ frustration levels, this will also make you residents happier. Most people can’t understand why the handyman can fix their neighbors problem and not theirs.\n\n<!-- ![Screenshot of an AppWork work order](img-end-five-steps.png) -->\n\n## Step Five: Do It Right the First Time\n\nCallbacks are the bane of every maintenance team and resident. Jimmy thinks the AC for Dr. Nelson is fixed, but Dr. Nelson calls the office back a day later, complaining about the sweltering heat. Technicians don’t like having to go back and residents don’t like needing a return visit. It’s a lose-lose situation.\n\nAlso, sometimes, you might hire an unscrupulous technician who’d rather lie about work instead of doing it. A technician like this will mark tasks as done when he has really done nothing.\n\nTo increase maintenance team efficiency, It is vital to track and reduce callbacks properly. As with skill assessment, technology can help manage and reduce callbacks. Imagine being able to see how many callbacks each technician gets within a specific time period, broken down by categories. If Tech A gets more callbacks when fixing fridges, then it might be better to send Tech A instead. Most important, if Tech C gets a callback with almost every single task he’s assigned, then it might be better to find a new technician altogether.\n\nReducing callbacks means a reduction in redundancies. This makes technicians happy, residents happy, and property managers happy (a win-win-win situation).\n\n## Work Orders and Technology\n\nGreater efficiency in work order management and cutting-edge technology go hand-in-hand. The ideal software platform will allow you to ensure that each maintenance team member keeps busy, knows about their tasks beforehand, gets the tasks best suited to their individual skillset, and can group tasks according to location. The same platform should provide supervisors and managers with comprehensive data and analytics to improve skill assessments and reduce callbacks.\n",

From the war in Ukraine to rising inflation, from interest rate hikes to increased rents, uncertainty fills the world.\n\nAccording to news sources such as [NPR](https://www.npr.org/2022/06/09/1103919413/rents-across-u-s-rise-above-2-000-a-month-for-the-first-time-ever) and [The Real Deal](https://therealdeal.com/2022/06/10/national-median-monthly-rent-hits-2k-for-first-time/), the national median rent has reached or surpassed two-thousand dollars for the first time in the United States. The rental market is more competitive than ever, making it an especially crucial time for multifamily communities to focus on and achieve greater efficiency.\n\nStrong management is non-negotiable. Not only does it help retain residents, but also the talent working with them. While the rental market is experiencing a high, so has the turnover of the operational staff. This turnover directly impacts resident satisfaction, not to mention the overall value of a property.\n\nThere are ways to increase efficiency for maximum results. The AppWork team details four strategies below, including tips on maximizing efficiency in the current work climate, plus the tools needed.\n\n### PropTech: Doing More with Less\n\nCompanies across the country are struggling to maintain enough staff for growing businesses. Nearly every sector has been affected. Scenes of long lines and excruciating wait times at check-out counters, restaurants, or even car rental pick-up are commonplace.\n\nThere are several reasons for the phenomena now called “[The Great Resignation](https://hbr.org/2022/03/the-great-resignation-didnt-start-with-the-pandemic)”: a hot job market, low unemployment, and runaway inflation. Firms everywhere need to do more with fewer staff members.\n\nFor the real estate sector, rental management or property technology software (such as AppWork and others) helps streamline workflows and empower employees and residents. These apps enable companies to hire fewer staff members and help those on staff be more effective.\n\nWith the right app, managers and techs can oversee multiple properties, units, employees, and work orders from the palm of their hands. Centralizing the team deepens the impact of each member. A good app also focuses on information sharing, connects the resident to the community staff, bolsters resident satisfaction, and solidifies higher retention rates.\n\nHowever, alongside software tools, there are other human and emotional variables that communities need to consider to increase NOI.\n\n### Better Attitudes, Better Collaboration\n\nIn the past, many firms and their internal departments held attitudes and prejudices that resulted in a feeling of, \"You do your job, and I will do mine.\" Nowadays, that attitude no longer works. Teamwork is not just a buzzword but a necessity for the success of a multifamily community. Residents often reflect the attitudes of staff members. Thus, the ambiance of the team affects the whole community.\n\nWhen hiring, managers need to focus not only on hard skills and years of experience but also on soft skills and natural attitudes. An upbeat attitude brings incredible value to any team.\n\nOn top of that, managers must treat their staff well. Not only in terms of fair compensation but as valuable team members who have much to contribute. With the right attitudes in check, a strong team will follow. An ambiance of collaboration acts like Miracle Grow in any workplace.\n\nThe atmosphere of a rental property starts with the staff. If the team is happy and the members feel valued, that energy will flow into their work. This energy overflows into the state of the property with well-tended gardens and promptly filled work orders. People tend to do higher-quality work when they work with positive energy and care about their job.\n\nTenants will witness the care going into the property and notice how quickly the team resolves their issues. Residents will feel appreciated and judge the value of living on the property. Happier residents increase the value of a community. Rent increases are inevitable. When a community is well-managed with high resident satisfaction, those increases are less of an obstacle for occupancy. People pay for quality.\n\nAbove all, an emphasis on teamwork is critical. All the benefits stem from the staff, large or small, working as a cohesive unit. Managers must nurture and encourage them. Everyone needs to believe: We are all in this together. Managers should strive to lead that credo by modeling it through actions.\n\nManagers can make employees feel valued with some easy things, like remembering their birthdays with a card or bringing donuts in from time to time. Small gestures make a big difference. Team-building events are invaluable. These events can include anything from hosting a team dinner, playing a round of miniature golf, or hiking together.\n\nGames, in particular, simple ones like card games and board games, teach managers a lot about their staff and build bonds that feel natural. Most importantly, managers should show that they genuinely care. People crave feeling cared for in any relationship, whether work-related or personal. People want to matter. Managers have the power to make people know that they count.\n\nIf the staff knows that their work matters and when they forge bonds, their work will prosper, along with their communities.\n\n<!-- ![Better teamwork leads to happier residents](img-middle-increase.png) -->\n\n### Inspect What You Expect: Follow-Up\n\nIn sales, as in life, follow-up is everything. Property managers and maintenance supervisors set the bar for their expectations by inspecting work orders.\n\nSupervisors will never get the results they want if they never personally inspect a technician's work. If they do not show up in person, they set a bad precedent by creating an opening for oversights to happen.\n\nIf technicians feel they are unmonitored, they start to believe the quality of their work is not important. They think it is their job, not the managers, to ensure the smooth running of the community. This thought process violates the main principle of collaboration by revisiting the old-time attitude of, \"You do your job, and I do mine.\"\n\nManagers are like commanders in the military. The buck stops with them. The more a manager cares, the more their techs will. Showing technicians concern about the caliber of their work helps build a positive team attitude. It lets them know that their work matters.\n\nAppWork includes an option for residents to rate and review technicians after the completion of a work order to enable follow-up. The reviews enable community managers to see the effectiveness of each deliverable.\n\nOf course, the more follow-up, the better. Property managers should communicate regularly with residents. They can ask about the technician's work and check in on how the resident feels overall about the community.\n\nManagers also need to speak with the technician and ask how everything went. Most importantly, they need to inspect the work done in person.\n\nManagers should not mistake micromanagement for caring. No one likes being micromanaged. No one. Managers need to trust their technicians and provide praise and encouragement in large doses. After following up with a tenant or inspecting the work personally, a manager should also discuss it with the service technician.\n\nA manager can build the tech up when they are on the right track, so he stays on the right track. They can contact them and convey something like, \"I just wanted to let you know that I saw the work you did in unit 301 and thought you did a great job.\"\n\nOr they can say, \"I gave the resident in unit 220 a call. She said you were super helpful. I appreciate you going the extra mile.\" Small moments of earned praise go far with staff and will encourage them to give their all.\n\nOf course, not every work order goes as planned. Sometimes residents are unhappy or blasé about the work done. Sometimes their feelings are justified. If that is the case, the manager needs to dig in and see what caused the issue. They also need to own the problem and make sure it gets resolved.\n\nFirst, the manager should communicate with the resident and show that she cares. Then, she needs to troubleshoot the issue or find someone who can troubleshoot the problem until the resident is satisfied.\n\nA [good manager](/proptech-news/succeed-as-property-manager/) takes care of what needs to be taken care of. Then they speak with the tech and give the feedback received from the resident. Both the manager and technician need to listen to the resident's feedback without being judgemental.\n\nSometimes, a service technician can explain why they completed the job in an unsatisfactory way. He might have personal problems, like a sick child or an impending divorce. The resident might have genuine interpersonal issues. Maybe the technician made an honest mistake and missed something.\n\nEveryone is human and makes mistakes. A good manager both shows empathy and keeps a lookout for recurring issues. They get to the root of the problem while showing understanding to both technician and the resident. They also make sure that it does not happen again. This foresight goes back to owning responsibilities.\n\nAppWork created a helpful checklist of suggestions for managing work orders and follow-ups:\n\n1. If using maintenance management software (like AppWork), make sure to read resident reviews. If residents are not reviewing work orders, follow up with them about the work done and encourage them to review work orders in the future.\n2. Even if a resident leaves a review, it is good to talk with them in person about the work order. Ask how the job went, and see if they have any other needs.\n3. It always helps to speak with the technician and get their take on the job. Let them know if the resident gave positive feedback, and make sure to praise them.\n4. Go to the unit and inspect the work personally. Nothing can replace an actual inspection.\n5. Some managers have found it helpful to tag along with technicians on jobs and provide a helping hand. The manager can gain valuable insight and experience by doing this. He will also build rapport with his team member.\n\n### Standardized Methods\n\nCommunity managers should not reinvent the wheel with each work order. They need written standards for every type of work order and make ready task. They should distribute and discuss their standards and make sure the whole team understands (and agrees) with them.\n\nWithin a community, every technician should follow the standard procedure. Standardization drives efficiency. If every technician follows the same workflow, then the team will feel more cohesive and unified.\n\n[Efficiency increases](/proptech-news/efficient-work-order-management/) when writing work orders uniformly, processing work orders in their proscribed method, and executing work orders in the same way across the board.\n\nMaintenance management PropTech (like AppWork) automatically standardize operational workflows, getting every team member on the same page. Whichever method a manager uses, each team member needs to know the step-by-step process from beginning to end. They should not be allowed to deviate from or customize the process.\n\nThe AppWork team recommends the following steps to standardize workflows in a community:\n\n1. Write down and codify the desired workflow. If this isn't accomplished already, then it is time to start! Gather every manager and supervisor together in one room or over video conference.\n2. Brew up some coffee and provide snacks. Walk through a list of every task within the community, and take detailed notes about how the team should handle each task.\n3. Everyone on the team should know the answers to basic questions like: How frequently do we mow the lawn? How often do we sweep the sidewalks? On which day do the trash collectors come? When must residents pay rent? What happens if they are late?\n4. Get a clear understanding and consensus on the community ecosystem. Map out every step at every level, from advertising vacancies to residents moving out. Think of the property as a dance and the standardization as the choreography, with every move dictated from beginning to end.\n5. Create categories, put each task into the appropriate category, and then outline the methodology of each one in a step-by-step process. Revise, edit, and streamline all the brainstorming. Then create a manual.\n6. Create digital or physical copies of this manual. Distribute one to every team member. Teach the team about the canonized workflow and provide whatever training is necessary.\n7. Watch senior team members train junior team members. This dual training provides reinforcement of what they learned and also builds camaraderie within the team.\n\nOf course, using maintenance management software makes the process easier. The AppWork team obviously recommends [AppWork](/solutions/work-order-app/). It comes with a built-in workflow created by seasoned owner-operators. It also provides plenty of customization for each community.\n\nEvery task has a category. The app uses machine learning to categorize work orders automatically. The technician app ensures a uniform process across the team. Managers can build a workflow that is digital, portable, and instantly sharable.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe strategies outlined in this article (better attitudes, follow-up, and standardization) will gain value over time, like compound interest. The ultimate goals are happier residents, engaged staff, efficiently run communities, and more profit.\n",

Managers have the power to make people know that they count.</p>\n<p>If the staff knows that their work matters and when they forge bonds, their work will prosper, along with their communities.</p>\n<h3>Inspect What You Expect: Follow-Up</h3>\n<p>In sales, as in life, follow-up is everything. Property managers and maintenance supervisors set the bar for their expectations by inspecting work orders.</p>\n<p>Supervisors will never get the results they want if they never personally inspect a technician's work. If they do not show up in person, they set a bad precedent by creating an opening for oversights to happen.</p>\n<p>If technicians feel they are unmonitored, they start to believe the quality of their work is not important. They think it is their job, not the managers, to ensure the smooth running of the community. This thought process violates the main principle of collaboration by revisiting the old-time attitude of, \"You do your job, and I do mine.\"</p>\n<p>Managers are like commanders in the military. The buck stops with them. The more a manager cares, the more their techs will. Showing technicians concern about the caliber of their work helps build a positive team attitude. It lets them know that their work matters.</p>\n<p>AppWork includes an option for residents to rate and review technicians after the completion of a work order to enable follow-up. The reviews enable community managers to see the effectiveness of each deliverable.</p>\n<p>Of course, the more follow-up, the better. Property managers should communicate regularly with residents. They can ask about the technician's work and check in on how the resident feels overall about the community.</p>\n<p>Managers also need to speak with the technician and ask how everything went. Most importantly, they need to inspect the work done in person.</p>\n<p>Managers should not mistake micromanagement for caring. No one likes being micromanaged. No one. Managers need to trust their technicians and provide praise and encouragement in large doses. After following up with a tenant or inspecting the work personally, a manager should also discuss it with the service technician.</p>\n<p>A manager can build the tech up when they are on the right track, so he stays on the right track. They can contact them and convey something like, \"I just wanted to let you know that I saw the work you did in unit 301 and thought you did a great job.\"</p>\n<p>Or they can say, \"I gave the resident in unit 220 a call. She said you were super helpful. I appreciate you going the extra mile.\" Small moments of earned praise go far with staff and will encourage them to give their all.</p>\n<p>Of course, not every work order goes as planned. Sometimes residents are unhappy or blasé about the work done. Sometimes their feelings are justified. If that is the case, the manager needs to dig in and see what caused the issue. They also need to own the problem and make sure it gets resolved.</p>\n<p>First, the manager should communicate with the resident and show that she cares. Then, she needs to troubleshoot the issue or find someone who can troubleshoot the problem until the resident is satisfied.</p>\n<p>A <a href=\"/proptech-news/succeed-as-property-manager/\">good manager</a> takes care of what needs to be taken care of. Then they speak with the tech and give the feedback received from the resident. Both the manager and technician need to listen to the resident's feedback without being judgemental.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a service technician can explain why they completed the job in an unsatisfactory way. He might have personal problems, like a sick child or an impending divorce. The resident might have genuine interpersonal issues. Maybe the technician made an honest mistake and missed something.</p>\n<p>Everyone is human and makes mistakes. A good manager both shows empathy and keeps a lookout for recurring issues. They get to the root of the problem while showing understanding to both technician and the resident. They also make sure that it does not happen again. This foresight goes back to owning responsibilities.</p>\n<p>AppWork created a helpful checklist of suggestions for managing work orders and follow-ups:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If using maintenance management software (like AppWork), make sure to read resident reviews. If residents are not reviewing work orders, follow up with them about the work done and encourage them to review work orders in the future.</li>\n<li>Even if a resident leaves a review, it is good to talk with them in person about the work order. Ask how the job went, and see if they have any other needs.</li>\n<li>It always helps to speak with the technician and get their take on the job. Let them know if the resident gave positive feedback, and make sure to praise them.</li>\n<li>Go to the unit and inspect the work personally. Nothing can replace an actual inspection.</li>\n<li>Some managers have found it helpful to tag along with technicians on jobs and provide a helping hand. The manager can gain valuable insight and experience by doing this. He will also build rapport with his team member.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Standardized Methods</h3>\n<p>Community managers should not reinvent the wheel with each work order. They need written standards for every type of work order and make ready task. They should distribute and discuss their standards and make sure the whole team understands (and agrees) with them.</p>\n<p>Within a community, every technician should follow the standard procedure. Standardization drives efficiency. If every technician follows the same workflow, then the team will feel more cohesive and unified.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/proptech-news/efficient-work-order-management/\">Efficiency increases</a> when writing work orders uniformly, processing work orders in their proscribed method, and executing work orders in the same way across the board.</p>\n<p>Maintenance management PropTech (like AppWork) automatically standardize operational workflows, getting every team member on the same page. Whichever method a manager uses, each team member needs to know the step-by-step process from beginning to end. They should not be allowed to deviate from or customize the process.</p>\n<p>The AppWork team recommends the following steps to standardize workflows in a community:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write down and codify the desired workflow. If this isn't accomplished already, then it is time to start! Gather every manager and supervisor together in one room or over video conference.</li>\n<li>Brew up some coffee and provide snacks. Walk through a list of every task within the community, and take detailed notes about how the team should handle each task.</li>\n<li>Everyone on the team should know the answers to basic questions like: How frequently do we mow the lawn? How often do we sweep the sidewalks? On which day do the trash collectors come? When must residents pay rent? What happens if they are late?</li>\n<li>Get a clear understanding and consensus on the community ecosystem. Map out every step at every level, from advertising vacancies to residents moving out. Think of the property as a dance and the standardization as the choreography, with every move dictated from beginning to end.</li>\n<li>Create categories, put each task into the appropriate category, and then outline the methodology of each one in a step-by-step process. Revise, edit, and streamline all the brainstorming. Then create a manual.</li>\n<li>Create digital or physical copies of this manual. Distribute one to every team member. Teach the team about the canonized workflow and provide whatever training is necessary.</li>\n<li>Watch senior team members train junior team members. This dual training provides reinforcement of what they learned and also builds camaraderie within the team.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, using maintenance management software makes the process easier. The AppWork team obviously recommends <a href=\"/solutions/work-order-app/\">AppWork</a>. It comes with a built-in workflow created by seasoned owner-operators. It also provides plenty of customization for each community.</p>\n<p>Every task has a category. The app uses machine learning to categorize work orders automatically. The technician app ensures a uniform process across the team. Managers can build a workflow that is digital, portable, and instantly sharable.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>The strategies outlined in this article (better attitudes, follow-up, and standardization) will gain value over time, like compound interest. The ultimate goals are happier residents, engaged staff, efficiently run communities, and more profit.</p>"

Once you have a good technician, or better yet, a good team of techs, then your number one focus should be keeping them happy and motivated.\n\nAccording to the [US Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/jolts.nr0.htm), Americans are quitting lower-paying, service-oriented jobs to find higher-paying jobs at historically high rates. Furthermore, [Gallup Research](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/351545/great-resignation-really-great-discontent.aspx) shows that most employees are either not engaged or actively disengaged, and are looking for new job opportunities.\n\nIn 2021, service workers, in general, started realizing what they’re worth. In 2022, you cannot take skilled maintenance technicians for granted. It’s time to start focusing on technician engagement. Let’s apply the [12 Elements for Employee Engagement](https://www.osha.gov/sites/default/files/2018-12/fy10_sh-20835-10_employee_engagement.pdf) from OSHA to property maintenance technicians.\n\n## How to Improve On-Site Maintenance Morale\n\n### #1: They need to know what’s expected.\n\nProperty maintenance technicians need to know what you expect from them daily. They should have a clearly defined list of tasks. They should have enough assignments to keep them busy for their entire workday. To ensure that your techs arrive to work with their service requests in order, you must prepare the night before.\n\nAlso, if you have a two-person team working together, and they need to tackle both make readies and regular work orders, then it might help to split the day for them, giving them structure. For example, focus on the make ready tasks before lunch, and the outstanding work orders after lunch. When techs have a clear focus for each part of the day, they’ll work efficiently and with less stress.\n\n### #2: People like to have a friend in the workplace.\n\nThis is about creating a positive culture for employees. The workplace environment will be defined and exemplified by you, the property manager! Avoid creating management versus maintenance feelings.\n\nOne way to stop your workday from being a battlefield is to pick your battles. Remember, with maintenance techs, let them do what keeps them happy, as long as the work gets done and the residents don’t complain. Do they want to work as a two-person team? Great. Do they need a flexible schedule so they can pick up their kids? Fine. Do they prefer a different brand of drills? Okay.\n\nAlso, be careful when hiring someone new. Skills can be taught. A good character and solid work ethic can’t be. A bad hire will bring down the morale of everyone, and he most likely won’t be anyone’s friend.\n\n### #3: Be concerned with the employee’s development, and give them periodic progress reports.\n\nIgnored employees are disengaged employees. Each maintenance crew member should have clearly defined KPIs, and time to review their numbers with you, at least once every three months.\n\nSome performance indicators that you can outline for them include:\n\n- Average work order completion time\n- Work order completion rate\n- Average rating from residents\n- Callback rate\n- Average time to turn a unit\n\nBe realistic and specific with the numbers you give them. If a technician feels that what you want is impossible, then they’ll be discouraged and won’t even try to improve. It’s important to establish a baseline before asking for improvement.\n\nTo create baseline measurements and future goals, you need data. It’s essential to have a way of measuring and storing average work order completion times, callback rates, etc. Robust analytics and customized reports are non-negotiable requirements for a property management software solution.\n\n### #4: Provide training and opportunities to grow as a technician.\n\nBefore sending your technician out for training, you should ask yourself some questions: Which skills does the property need the most? What is the technician interested in learning about? In which area is the technician weakest, and do they want to improve in that area?\n\nThere should be some overlap between these points of data. Your maintenance management software should be able to provide you with the following information:\n\n- How many service requests were created per month within each maintenance category?\n- What is the completion rate for each category?\n- For which category does your technician get the highest resident ratings?\n- For which category do they get the lowest?\n- For which category do they get the most callbacks?\n\nOnce you have the data, then it’s time to talk with your technicians, so you can create personalized training schedules. Try to integrate training into the weekly schedule.\n\nFor example, if you have two techs who both struggle with leaking pipes, forcing you to call a third-party plumber all the time, then have them shadow the plumber the next time he comes (assuming the plumber is highly qualified, competent, and willing to train).\n\nEven if you have to pay the plumber for training, you’ll end up saving money when you don’t need his services in the future. The gist of this concept: 1. Find the best in the field; 2. Get hands-on training for your technicians.\n\n### #5: Have in stock all the tools and equipment the team needs.\n\nTechnicians need to have proper resources to complete their jobs. When technicians don’t have what they need for a job, then the work simply can’t get done. Staying on top of supplies, and ordering them on time, are ultimately your responsibilities as their manager.\n\nMissing equipment is one of the most common complaints made by technicians. This includes delays caused by late deliveries. Currently, at the end of 2021, there is a massive supply chain problem in the USA. Chances are, this problem will continue well into 2022. That means being more diligent than ever when it comes to keeping the shop well stocked.\n\n<!-- ![image of a table full of tools](img-motivate-tools.png) -->\n\nChecking parts and supplies should be part of your end-of-the-day preparations for the next day. Once you’ve assigned tasks to your technicians, it’s important to make sure they will have what they need to complete those tasks.\n\nAnother idea, from an experienced maintenance supervisor, is to purchase dedicated tools for each crew or team member. This reduces friction and infighting, resulting in a more productive and happy team.\n\n### #6: Allow them to do what they do best every day.\n\nSuccess breeds success. Find a way to give technicians the tasks they enjoy and do well. If one technician enjoys painting, then she’ll do a much better job than another technician who hates it.\n\nAlso, part of letting employees shine is letting go and letting them do things their way. Avoid micromanagement. Tell them the results you want, and let them achieve those results their way. Your technicians might surprise you with their capacity for ingenuity and creative problem-solving.\n\n### #7: Give feedback and recognition for a job well done.\n\nLack of recognition is a major complaint, if not the biggest one, from technicians. A manager needs to celebrate both little and big successes. While verbal praise is important, real celebration comes as a tangible reward.\n\nThe crew cut completion times in half with fewer callbacks? Take them out to burgers or get everyone a new Leatherman multi-tool as a gift.\n\nA single technician got a glowing review from a happy resident? Give them a gift card or a six-pack of their favorite beer.\n\nThe whole team averaged over 4 stars for the month’s reviews and improved completion times? Go on a coffee and donut run at the end of the week, making sure to get everyone’s favorite.\n\nOne technician pushed hard to finish a complex and difficult task? Give them half a day off for wellness and relaxation.\n\nDid the whole team work hard to hand in, on time, all units for this month’s move-ins? Did the residents create zero work orders within the first week after moving in? That sounds like a job done perfectly the first time. A month like that deserves a bonus.\n\nPlus, if the technicians know beforehand that they can earn a bonus and how much that bonus will be, they’ll be motivated to achieve the prerequisite goals.\n\n### #8: The technicians should feel that their supervisor genuinely cares and appreciates them.\n\nThis is where empathy and active listening come into play.\n\nIs a technician underperforming this month? Before getting upset, it’s worthwhile to see how you can help. Some questions to ask include:\n\n- Do you have all the equipment you need to complete this task?\n- Is there an unforeseen complication creating problems with this make ready?\n- Do you feel confident about knowing how to fix this?\n\nIf technicians trust their manager, then they can be honest when they are lacking the tools or knowledge to complete a job.\n\nAlso, sometimes technicians might need just a little empathy. Let them rant about the lady in Unit 101. Listen to them when they talk about problems with their teenager. Sympathize with them when their dog dies. By just offering a listening ear, you’re showing that your care is genuine.\n\n### #9: Encourage technicians to improve and develop themselves.\n\nEncouragement comes in many forms. Look for ways of incentivizing and rewarding that don’t cost money. For example:\n\n- Acknowledge a tech’s success in front of the entire staff during a weekly meeting\n- Give them verbal appreciation\n- Write them a small thank you note, detailing what you appreciate\n- Use a maintenance management software that gives badges when reaching goals\n\n<!-- ![picture of a happy maintenance technician](img-motivate-happy.png) -->\n\nBy focusing on what technicians are doing right, you provide positive reinforcement for their actions. [Recent studies](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083709/) state conclusively: “Positive reinforcement works exceedingly better and faster than punishment.”\n\nDon’t forget that vague, generalized praise comes across as insincere. Pinpoint their accomplishments and call out the details. Instead of “Great job today!”, you can say, “I see you worked for hours cleaning all the grease off the kitchen tiles and cabinets. It looks great.”\n\nWhen you notice and point out specifics, the technicians will feel that you see what they do, that you appreciate it, and your appreciation will inspire them to keep up the good work.\n\n### #10: Make their opinion count.\n\nIs your work order completion rate too low, and you’re not sure how to fix it? Invite everyone to sit down together and start brainstorming. Explain the problem, and see what solutions are suggested.\n\nWhen someone comes up with a great idea, you can use that idea as a source of praise, for example:\n\n- “Let’s implement Alex’s idea. That could really help.”\n- “I think today we need the Alex maneuver.”\n- “I want to try out what Alex suggested.”\n\nEvery time you use a technician’s idea and attach her name to that idea, she’ll feel a little burst of pride.\n\n### #11: Make them feel like they are part of something important.\n\nTurning an apartment can take a tremendous amount of time and energy, depending on the unit and property. While some residents take good care of their units, some don’t. The technician might have to replace outlets and switches, resurface tubs, replace doors and flooring, fix large holes in plasterboard walls, scrub the walls and spackle them before painting, and so on.\n\nA resident who cooks with large amounts of grease and oil might leave a kitchen covered in difficult-to-remove grime. A resident might have had kids who used the walls to express themselves artistically in multiple mediums.\n\nImagine working hard to fix these units only to see them destroyed again, year after year. Every person wants to feel that the work they do is meaningful. It’s hard for a technician to find meaning in their work when it feels like everything they do gets reverted.\n\nYour maintenance crew is the axis around which your property spins. Make sure they know that. They also need to know that a maintenance team can make or break a property. When you say things like this daily, and back up your words by treating technicians with respect, courtesy, good wages, and benefits, then technicians will start to feel that the overall success of the property is their success too.\n\n### #12: It’s important that they feel that every employee, from the top down, is dedicated to quality work.\n\nActions speak louder than words. Managers who want hard-working, dedicated, and successful employees need to model those ethics. One idea from a veteran property manager is to spend a day working alongside your technicians. Go and help them make a unit ready for a new resident. If you’ve never done this type of work before, it can be a real eye-opening experience.\n\nAnother part of this is having reasonable expectations. A boss who expects more than it’s possible to do in one day does not value the quality of a technician’s work. Fast work becomes sloppy work. Sloppy work results in callbacks, complaints, and residents leaving.\n\n[According to a recent study in the UK](https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity), the average office worker actually puts in three hours of work per day. If your technicians put in a solid 5-6 hours of working on tasks every day, then they are extraordinary. The first hour of a technician’s day might look something like this:\n\n9:00 AM: Arrive, greet everyone, hang up your coat or bag, and grab a coffee\n9:15 AM: Review the days’ tasks with the manager or supervisor\n9:30 AM: Gather the tools and equipment needed for the days’ tasks.\n9:50 AM: Head out to the first property of the day, making a pit stop on the way\n\nThat’s a whole hour gone, and they haven’t even started the actual maintenance work. Also, this is a serious worker, who isn’t dawdling and wasting time. Add in 30 minutes for lunch, and 30 minutes for short breaks during the day. Now you have 6 hours left for working on tasks.\n\nPlus, how much time does it take for them to travel between units and properties? How congested are the roads? Make sure to include travel time when calculating how much work you expect to get done. How much time does it take to set up for each task? How much time to clean up afterward? How much time does the paperwork for each task take?\n\nWhen you give technicians the time they need to do a job right, then you have a better chance of them doing it right the first time. Also, it helps to have a property maintenance management app that makes it easy for techs to comment and add notes about their work orders while they’re on-site. A good app for technicians removes the need for paperwork altogether, resulting in happier techs.\n\n## Happy Technicians are the Foundation of Success { class=\"heading-conclusion\" }\n\nAccording to another [Gallup study](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx), US businesses lose $1 trillion every year to employee turnover. Your properties cannot succeed if your technicians are disengaged. Happy technicians perform better with fewer mistakes. This increases your residents’ satisfaction, improving retention rates. When managers invest time, energy, and money in technicians, in the long run, they most likely will be getting more than what they gave.\n",

A month like that deserves a bonus.</p>\n<p>Plus, if the technicians know beforehand that they can earn a bonus and how much that bonus will be, they’ll be motivated to achieve the prerequisite goals.</p>\n<h3>#8: The technicians should feel that their supervisor genuinely cares and appreciates them.</h3>\n<p>This is where empathy and active listening come into play.</p>\n<p>Is a technician underperforming this month? Before getting upset, it’s worthwhile to see how you can help. Some questions to ask include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you have all the equipment you need to complete this task?</li>\n<li>Is there an unforeseen complication creating problems with this make ready?</li>\n<li>Do you feel confident about knowing how to fix this?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If technicians trust their manager, then they can be honest when they are lacking the tools or knowledge to complete a job.</p>\n<p>Also, sometimes technicians might need just a little empathy. Let them rant about the lady in Unit 101. Listen to them when they talk about problems with their teenager. Sympathize with them when their dog dies. By just offering a listening ear, you’re showing that your care is genuine.</p>\n<h3>#9: Encourage technicians to improve and develop themselves.</h3>\n<p>Encouragement comes in many forms. Look for ways of incentivizing and rewarding that don’t cost money. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Acknowledge a tech’s success in front of the entire staff during a weekly meeting</li>\n<li>Give them verbal appreciation</li>\n<li>Write them a small thank you note, detailing what you appreciate</li>\n<li>Use a maintenance management software that gives badges when reaching goals</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By focusing on what technicians are doing right, you provide positive reinforcement for their actions. <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29083709/\">Recent studies</a> state conclusively: “Positive reinforcement works exceedingly better and faster than punishment.”</p>\n<p>Don’t forget that vague, generalized praise comes across as insincere. Pinpoint their accomplishments and call out the details. Instead of “Great job today!”, you can say, “I see you worked for hours cleaning all the grease off the kitchen tiles and cabinets. It looks great.”</p>\n<p>When you notice and point out specifics, the technicians will feel that you see what they do, that you appreciate it, and your appreciation will inspire them to keep up the good work.</p>\n<h3>#10: Make their opinion count.</h3>\n<p>Is your work order completion rate too low, and you’re not sure how to fix it? Invite everyone to sit down together and start brainstorming. Explain the problem, and see what solutions are suggested.</p>\n<p>When someone comes up with a great idea, you can use that idea as a source of praise, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Let’s implement Alex’s idea. That could really help.”</li>\n<li>“I think today we need the Alex maneuver.”</li>\n<li>“I want to try out what Alex suggested.”</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Every time you use a technician’s idea and attach her name to that idea, she’ll feel a little burst of pride.</p>\n<h3>#11: Make them feel like they are part of something important.</h3>\n<p>Turning an apartment can take a tremendous amount of time and energy, depending on the unit and property. While some residents take good care of their units, some don’t. The technician might have to replace outlets and switches, resurface tubs, replace doors and flooring, fix large holes in plasterboard walls, scrub the walls and spackle them before painting, and so on.</p>\n<p>A resident who cooks with large amounts of grease and oil might leave a kitchen covered in difficult-to-remove grime. A resident might have had kids who used the walls to express themselves artistically in multiple mediums.</p>\n<p>Imagine working hard to fix these units only to see them destroyed again, year after year. Every person wants to feel that the work they do is meaningful. It’s hard for a technician to find meaning in their work when it feels like everything they do gets reverted.</p>\n<p>Your maintenance crew is the axis around which your property spins. Make sure they know that. They also need to know that a maintenance team can make or break a property. When you say things like this daily, and back up your words by treating technicians with respect, courtesy, good wages, and benefits, then technicians will start to feel that the overall success of the property is their success too.</p>\n<h3>#12: It’s important that they feel that every employee, from the top down, is dedicated to quality work.</h3>\n<p>Actions speak louder than words. Managers who want hard-working, dedicated, and successful employees need to model those ethics. One idea from a veteran property manager is to spend a day working alongside your technicians. Go and help them make a unit ready for a new resident. If you’ve never done this type of work before, it can be a real eye-opening experience.</p>\n<p>Another part of this is having reasonable expectations. A boss who expects more than it’s possible to do in one day does not value the quality of a technician’s work. Fast work becomes sloppy work. Sloppy work results in callbacks, complaints, and residents leaving.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity\">According to a recent study in the UK</a>, the average office worker actually puts in three hours of work per day. If your technicians put in a solid 5-6 hours of working on tasks every day, then they are extraordinary. The first hour of a technician’s day might look something like this:</p>\n<p>9:00 AM: Arrive, greet everyone, hang up your coat or bag, and grab a coffee\n9:15 AM: Review the days’ tasks with the manager or supervisor\n9:30 AM: Gather the tools and equipment needed for the days’ tasks.\n9:50 AM: Head out to the first property of the day, making a pit stop on the way</p>\n<p>That’s a whole hour gone, and they haven’t even started the actual maintenance work. Also, this is a serious worker, who isn’t dawdling and wasting time. Add in 30 minutes for lunch, and 30 minutes for short breaks during the day. Now you have 6 hours left for working on tasks.</p>\n<p>Plus, how much time does it take for them to travel between units and properties? How congested are the roads? Make sure to include travel time when calculating how much work you expect to get done. How much time does it take to set up for each task? How much time to clean up afterward? How much time does the paperwork for each task take?</p>\n<p>When you give technicians the time they need to do a job right, then you have a better chance of them doing it right the first time. Also, it helps to have a property maintenance management app that makes it easy for techs to comment and add notes about their work orders while they’re on-site. A good app for technicians removes the need for paperwork altogether, resulting in happier techs.</p>\n<h2>Happy Technicians are the Foundation of Success { class=\"heading-conclusion\" }</h2>\n<p>According to another <a href=\"https://www.gallup.com/workplace/247391/fixable-problem-costs-businesses-trillion.aspx\">Gallup study</a>, US businesses lose $1 trillion every year to employee turnover. Your properties cannot succeed if your technicians are disengaged. Happy technicians perform better with fewer mistakes. This increases your residents’ satisfaction, improving retention rates. When managers invest time, energy, and money in technicians, in the long run, they most likely will be getting more than what they gave.</p>"
